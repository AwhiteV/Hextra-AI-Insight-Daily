### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will hold onto Your Personal Data only for as long as needed for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use Your Personal Data as much as necessary to comply with our legal obligations (like, if we absolutely have to keep Your data for applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter time. The only exceptions are if we use this data to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally required to keep it longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information, including Personal Data, gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. This means Your info might be moved to and kept on computers outside of Your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction. Heads up: the data protection laws in those places might be different from yours.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and then submitting such info, You're essentially giving a thumbs-up to that transfer.

The Company will do everything reasonably necessary to make sure Your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer Your Personal Data to an organization or a country unless there are proper controls in place, including solid security for Your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete, or ask us to help delete, the Personal Data we've collected about You.

Our Service might let You delete certain info about Yourself right from within the Service.

You can always update, modify, or delete Your info by signing in to Your Account (if You have one!) and heading to the account settings section. This section lets You manage Your personal information. You can also hit us up to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info You've given us.

Just a heads-up, though: we might need to hang onto certain info if we have a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or an asset sale, Your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give You a heads-up before Your Personal Data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Sometimes, the Company might have to spill Your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) make a valid request.

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill Your Personal Data if we genuinely believe such action is needed to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us. But hey, keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% secure. While we totally try our best to use commercially acceptable ways to protect Your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable information from anyone under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and know Your kid has given us Personal Data, please hit us up! If we discover we've collected Personal Data from someone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll quickly zap that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent to process Your info, and Your country requires a parent's go-ahead, we might ask for Your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If You click on a third-party link, You'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend You check out the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.

We have zero control over, and take no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. We'll let You know about any changes by simply posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give You a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service. We'll also update the "Last Updated Date" at the very top of this Privacy Policy.
