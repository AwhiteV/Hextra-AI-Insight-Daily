# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we" going forward)! Before diving in, please make sure to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you're totally agreeing to everything in these Terms.

## 1. Our Services
Our Services at ai.hubtoday offer a sweet deal of paid subscription content and member services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, community vibes, and more! Just a heads-up, some content is only for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
To get started, you'll need to provide a valid email and set up a password.
Your account, your responsibility! You're on the hook for its security and all activities. **No sharing or transferring** your account, capiche?
We at ai.hubtoday totally reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you ever breach these Terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
Our Paid Subscription Services run on a monthly/annual billing cycle, with all fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
Payments? They're all handled securely via third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal). Relax, we don't store any of your payment info!
Heads up! Your subscription will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Don't wanna be surprised, right?
**14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you've got 14 days from your purchase date to snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email below and tell us why you're bailing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first time subscribing, all payments are **non-refundable** unless the law explicitly says otherwise. Fair's fair!

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
All original content? That's **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**! So, no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial purposes without our green light.
You're getting a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our stuff, strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure. Keep it chill, folks!
Wanna use our content for commercial gigs or quote extensively? Just hit us up for permission first.

## 5. User Conduct Rules
Let's keep things cool here. It's a **big no-no** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights.
Also, **don't even think about** using tech tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content. Seriously, don't.
We reserve the right to yank any inappropriate content and **ban rule-breakers** from the site. Play nice, peeps!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
Just so you know, we totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or pull the plug on any part of our services (or all of them!) whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how the tech world rolls sometimes.
And hey, if something's temporarily out of reach due to crazy unforeseen stuff, server hiccups, or third-party service outages, we're **not liable for any damages**. It's out of our hands, literally!

## 7. Disclaimer
Heads up! The info we dish out on this site is purely for your reference. It's **not meant to be** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, you get the drift).
So, for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services, we're **not on the hook**. Just sayin', use your own judgment!

## 8. Governing Law
These Terms? They're totally governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without fussing over conflict of law principles.
Got a beef related to these Terms? Let's try to hash it out amicably first. If that doesn't fly, you agree to let the courts in Santa Clara County, California, handle it. Fair game!
